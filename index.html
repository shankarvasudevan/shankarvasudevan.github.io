		<h1>My blog</h1>
		<h2>Intro<h2>
		As a software developer of over half a dozen years, I have a great deal of experience in how to build great products. However, as I progress in my career, I am learning more and more that building a great product is more than just about building good software. It's about knowing your customers, understanding their business as well as your own and designing a solution to their problem (that may sometimes not even involve software). In this blog, I am going to discuss my learnings on the following:
		* Building great software (with particular focus on C#, as it is my language of choice)
		* Building a great end-product - Looking at business requirements and UX
		* Providing tangible value to your customers - Through being able to dissect their problems and get to the core of the value add.I will be sharing my own experiences, learnings from books and articles, as well as insights from those in the industry today.
